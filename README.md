# Tad's Dotfiles

In computing a "dot file" is a hidden directory or
file on a UNIX/Linux system that are so named because the file is prefixed
with a full stop. Dotfiles within a user's home directory contain most of
the user-specific configuration available on a desktop and are configured
manually or through the use of tools.
